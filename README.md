# Esp8266_Micropython

This project includes firmwares written in Micropython for ESP8266 board, they are complementary to a Discord-nodejs-bot that I wrote to interact with
Shinobi Cctv ( see https://shinobi.video/ ) and to prevent my garden to get thirsty.


MqttGarden2 it controls a board with 2 relays to handles two valves in my garden
MqttPir     its goal is to trigger an allarm to Shinobi when someone passes under the sensor

All the comunications are done using Mqtt protocol
